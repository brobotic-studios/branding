# branding
This branch is for the actual distribution of assets, aka **THIS IS PRODUCTION**
as far as brand assets are concerned. We want to keep the file structure nice
and tidy, with no originals and only nice web-optimized distributable files.

## Formats and Folder Structure
Below is the folder structure, with brief explanations as to the contents.
Top-level folders are meant to define the *type* of content found within, where
the content will then be organized by *project* in folders below.

  * `stylesheets` (holds CSS stylesheets)
    * `brobotic` (general branding and default styles)
    * `klobbe` (unique CSS and/or overrides for the Klobbe project)
    * ...
  * `images` (sort of self-explanatory)
    * `brobotic`
    * `klobbe`
    * ...
  * `fonts`
    * `brobotic`
    * ...
