# Brobotic Branding

This project is for all of the assets to maintain proper branding for the studio
in general. It is what we are referring to when mentioning the "Brobotic brand,"
"studio brand," or most other similar vague references to "the" brand.

## CSS Project

The CSS is built on top of the (Semantic UI)[http://semantic-ui.com] framework.
All its dependencies are managed by Node.js in the `css` folder. To rebuild the
distribution, run `gulp build` or `gulp` to rebuild automatically upon source
file changes. Use `gulp help` for more on all the available commands from the
gulp build tool.

After building, final assets are in the `dist` subdirectory, named `semantic.*`.
The minified versions (`semantic.min.*` files) are what should be copied into
production.

# Fonts

Haven't really addressed fonts yet. We will though...
